/**
 * A list that supports lazy acquisition and release of items.
 *
 * Platform adapters (RecyclerView, Compose) detect this interface and automatically
 * manage item lifecycle - acquiring items as they enter the viewport and releasing
 * them when they leave.
 *
 * Accessing items via [get] automatically acquires them. Use [release] to free
 * cached values when items leave the viewport, and [releaseAll] during cleanup.
 *
 * Example usage in a Compose adapter:
 * ```kotlin
 * @Composable
 * fun <T> List<T>.rememberItem(index: Int, key: Any): T {
 *     if (this is LazyList<T>) {
 *         DisposableEffect(key) { onDispose { release(index) } }
 *     }
 *     return this[index]
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Example usage in a RecyclerView adapter:
 * ```kotlin
 * override fun onViewDetachedFromWindow(holder: VH) {
 *     super.onViewDetachedFromWindow(holder)
 *     items.releaseIfLazy(holder.bindingAdapterPosition)
 * }
 * ```
